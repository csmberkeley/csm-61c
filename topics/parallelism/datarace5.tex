\begin{verbatim}
int num_threads = 4;
omp_set_num_threads(num_threads); 
int start = omp_get_thread_num();

#pragma omp parallel 
{ 
    for (int x = start; x < len; x+=4) { 
        *(A+x) = x; 
    } 
} 


\end{verbatim}

Is the code: \\
A) Always Incorrect \\
B) Sometimes Incorrect \\ 
C) Always Correct, Slower than Serial \\
D) Always Correct, Speed relative to Serial depends on Caching Scheme \\
E) Always Correct, Faster than Serial \\

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
A \\
Justification: We defined the start variable outside the parallel section. So start will be 0 for all threads, and thus all threads will be modifying the part of the array thatâ€™s assigned to thread 0. 

\end{solution}
