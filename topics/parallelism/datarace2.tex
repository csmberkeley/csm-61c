Is the code: \\
A) Always Incorrect \\
B) Sometimes Incorrect \\ 
C) Always Correct, Slower than Serial \\
D) Always Correct, Speed relative to Serial depends on Caching Scheme \\
E) Always Correct, Faster than Serial \\

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
C\\
Justification: 
Our code computes the correct result but will be slower than the serial equivalent due to duplication of work. 

Detailed justification:
This is the naive implementation of parallelism. Each thread does the entire job on its own, so there are no concurrency issues. 

However, since the serial solution would be the same as our parallel solution, but with only 1 thread, since we can dedicate more resources to a single thread, this solution will be slower.
