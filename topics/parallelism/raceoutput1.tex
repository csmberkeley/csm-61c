\question
For the following pieces of code, determine which of the given outputs would be possible during a single execution of the snippet. Assume \texttt{OMP\_NUM\_THREADS=4}.

\begin{verbatim}
#pragma omp parallel {
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        printf("%d", i);
    }
}
\end{verbatim}

Select all of the following outputs that are possible:

Output 1: \texttt{000011112222} \\
Output 2: \texttt{100001222112} \\
Output 3: \texttt{000111102222} \\
Output 4: \texttt{010011201212} \\
Output 5: \texttt{012012012012} \\
Output 6: \texttt{010012201212} \\

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
1, 5, 6 \\
Justification: Note that before every 2, there must be a corresponding 1, and before every 1 there must be a corresponding 0. Working backwards, we can see that outputs 2 and 3 have a 1 with no corresponding 0 and that output 4 has 5 1s. 

\end{solution}
