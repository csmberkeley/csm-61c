\question For the following questions, assume the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item 16-bit virtual addresses
\item 4 KiB page size
\item 16 KiB of physical memory with LRU page replacement policy
\item Fully Associative TLB with 4 entries and an LRU replacement policy
\end{itemize}

\begin{parts}
\part
What is the maximum number of virtual pages per process?

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
4 KiB page size = 12 offset bigs -> 4 bits for VPN -> $2^4$ virtual pages = 16 virtual pages
\end{solution}
    
\part
How many bits wide is the page table base register?

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
The page table base register is in memory so it's the same length as the physical address. 16 KiB physical memory = $2^{14}$ B so we have 14 bits.
\end{solution}
