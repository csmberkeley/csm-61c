\question
For the following questions, assume the following (IEC prefixes are on the green sheet):
\begin{itemize}
\item You can ignore any accesses to instruction memory (code)
\item 16 EiB virtual address space per process
\item 256 MiB page size
\item 4 GiB of physical address space
\item Fully Associative TLB with 5 entries and an LRU replacement policy
\item All arrays of doubles are page-aligned (start on a page boundary) and do not overlap
\item All arrays are of a size equivalent to some nonzero integer multiple of 256 MiB
\item All structs are tightly packed (field are stored contiguously)
\item All accesses to structs and arrays go out to caches/memory (there is no optimization by reusing values loaded into registers)
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
void dblCpy(doubleFun* measurer, double* dblsToCpy) {
    measurer->fun = 0;
    for (uint32_t i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE; i += 4) {
        measurer->dbl[i] += dblsToCpy[i];
        measurer->fun += dblsToCpy[i];
    }
    measurer->fun /= ARRAY_SIZE;
}
\end{verbatim}

\part
How many virtual page number bits are there and virtual address offset bits are there?
\begin{solution}[0.3in]
VPN: 36 Offset: 28
\end{solution}

\part
How many physical page number bits are there and pysical address offset bits are there?
\begin{solution}[0.3in]
PPN: 4 Offset: 28
\end{solution}
