\question 
With this machine, we now first run program1, which accesses the memory address in the following way:

For each access, translate the address into the physical memory address accessed, assuming that the pages are assigned ordinally, and the first 2 page numbers are already assigned, so you start with the third page. Then, answer whether it is a cache hit, a compulsory miss, a conflict miss, or a capacity miss.

\begin{parts}
\part
0xFFFFF123

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
Physical address: 0x002123 \\
Compulsory miss
\end{solution}

\part
0xFFFFE123

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
Physical address: 0x003123 \\
Compulsory miss
\end{solution}

\part
0xFFFFF000

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
Physical address: 0x002000 \\
Compulsory miss
\end{solution}

\part
0xFFFFF1FF

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
Physical address: 0x0021FF \\
Cache hit
\end{solution}

\end{parts}
