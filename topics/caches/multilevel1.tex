\question
A machine has an 8 way set associative cache with 512 B of data. The size of each block is 16 B and there are 8 MiB of main memory. How large are the tag, index, and offset fields for an address on this machine using this cache?

\begin{solution}[0.7in]
Tag: ​17 Index: ​2 Offset: ​4

Detailed solution:
$8$ MiB ($2^23$ B) main memory $\rightarrow$ $23$ bit memory address\\
cache size = $512$ B = $2^9$ B\\
block size = $16$ B = $2^4$ B\\
number of blocks = cache size / block size = $\frac{2^9}{2^4}$ = $2^5$\\
number of sets = number of blocks / associativity = $\frac{2^5}{8} = 2^2 = 4$\\
$I$ = $\log_2$(num of sets) = $\log_2 4 = 2$\\
$O$ = $\log_2$(block size) = $\log_2 2^4 = 4$\\
$T$ = number of total address bits $- I - O = 23 - 2 - 4 = 17$\\
\end{solution}
