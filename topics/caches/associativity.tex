\question
What happens to the distribution of bits as associativity increases? Decreases?

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
Increasing associativity decreases the number of bits for the index, but increases the number of bits for the tag ($+1$ associativity -> $-1$ index, $+1$ tag). Decreasing the associativity causes the opposite trend.
\end{solution}
