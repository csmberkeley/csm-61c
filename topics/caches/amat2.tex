\question
When evaluating your codeâ€™s performance, you find an AMAT of 4 cycles. Your L1 cache hits in 2 cycles and it takes 100 cycles to go to main memory. What is the L1 hit rate?

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
AMAT = L1 Hit time + L1 Miss rate * L1 Miss penalty, and L1 hit rate = 1 - L1 miss rate \\
$4 = 2 + L1MR * 100$ $\rightarrow$ $L1MR = \frac{1}{50} = 2\%$, so L1 hit rate = $98\%$

\end{solution}
