\question
Consider the following cache setup: We have an L1 cache with a hit time of 2 cycles, L2 cache with a hit time of 18 cycles and a 15\% local miss rate and a global miss rate of 5\%. If main memory accesses take 60 cycles, what is the AMAT for this caching hierarchy in clock cycles?

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
$L1$ MR = $.05 / .15 = \frac{1}{3}$ \\
AMAT = $2 + \frac{1}{3} (18 + .15 * 60) = 2 + 6 + 60 * .05 = 2 + 6 + 3 = 11$ \\
AMAT = 11 cycles

\end{solution}
