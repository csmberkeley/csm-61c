\question
For each sequence of memory accesses below, determine whether each memory access is a hit, compulsory miss, conflict miss, or capacity miss. Assume each cache has 4 KiB of memory split into 256 B blocks, and that the reads occurred in order.

\begin{parts}
\part
Cache Type: Direct-Mapped:
Reads:
\lstinline$0xABCD$
\lstinline$0xABEF$

\begin{solution}[0.7in]
\lstinline$0xABCD$: Compulsory Miss
\lstinline$0xABEF$: Hit
\end{solution}

\part
Cache Type: 4-way Set-Associative:
Reads:
\lstinline$0xABCD$
\lstinline$0xBBCD$

\begin{solution}[0.7in]
\lstinline$0xABCD$: Compulsory Miss
\lstinline$0xBBCD$: Compulsory Miss
META: Students might be confused why the second miss is not a conflict miss. Because the cache is 4-way set associative, loading an item which maps to the same set as 0xABCD doesn't conflict with the previous memory block.
\end{solution}

\part
Cache Type: Fully Associative
Reads:
\lstinline$0xAABB$
\lstinline$0xBBCC$

\begin{solution}[0.7in]
\lstinline$0xAABB$: Compulsory Miss
\lstinline$0xBBCC$: Compulsory Miss
\end{solution}
