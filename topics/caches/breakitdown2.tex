\question
For each sequence of memory accesses below, determine whether each memory access is a hit, compulsory miss, conflict miss, or capacity miss. You are given that each cache is 4 KiB in size and has 256 B blocks, and that the reads occurred in order.

\begin{parts}
\part
Cache Type: Direct-Mapped:
Reads:
\lstinline$0xABCD$
\lstinline$0xABEF$

\begin{solution}
\lstinline$0xABCD$: Compulsory Miss
\lstinline$0xABEF$: Hit
\end{solution}

\part
Cache Type: 4-way Set-Associative:
Reads:
\lstinline$0xABCD$
\lstinline$0xBBCD$

\begin{solution}
\lstinline$0xABCD$: Compulsory Miss
\lstinline$0xBBCD$: Compulsory Miss
META: This isn't a conflict miss. You've got 4-ways per set, so loading an item which maps to the same set as 0xABCD doesn't conflict.
\end{solution}

\part
Cache Type: Fully Associative
Reads:
\lstinline$0xAABB$
\lstinline$0xBBCC$

\begin{solution}
\lstinline$0xAABB$: Compulsory Miss
\lstinline$0xBBCC$: Compulsory Miss
\end{solution}
