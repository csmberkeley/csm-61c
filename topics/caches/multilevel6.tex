\question
If we change the L1 cache from being direct mapped to being fully associative with LRU, how does its hit rate change on the same code? Does it increase, decrease, not change at all, or is it impossible to tell?

\begin{solution}[0.7in]
No Change

The basic idea is that we never look back at a block once we've gone past it after its fetched from memory. So a cache of any associativity would not help.
