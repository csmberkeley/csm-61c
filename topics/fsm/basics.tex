Suppose we want to design a FSM that takes a single bit (1/0) as input, and outputs a single bit (1/0). We want the FSM to output true (1) only if it has seen three consecutive 1’s as its input. Let’s design it!

\question
Given the following input streams, fill in what the FSM should output at each time step:
\begin{parts}

\item
\begin{tabular}{ |l|l|l|l|l| } 
 \hline
 In & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
 \hline
 Out & & & & \\
 \hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{solution}
\begin{tabular}{ |l|l|l|l|l| } 
 \hline
 In & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
 \hline
 Out & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
 \hline
\end{tabular}
The FSM has only seen individual 1’s (non-consecutive), so it should output only zeros.
\end{solution}
\item

\begin{tabular}{ |l|l|l|l|l| } 
 \hline
 In & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
 \hline
 Out & & & & \\
 \hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{solution}
\begin{tabular}{ |l|l|l|l|l| } 
 \hline
 In & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
 \hline
 Out & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
 \hline
\end{tabular}
The FSM has only seen two consecutive 1’s, but not three. It should still output only zeros.
\end{solution}

\item
\begin{tabular}{ |l|l|l|l|l| } 
 \hline
 In & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
 \hline
 Out & & & & \\
 \hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{solution}
\begin{tabular}{ |l|l|l|l|l| } 
 \hline
 In & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
 \hline
 Out & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
 \hline
\end{tabular}
The FSM has finally seen three consecutive 1’s, but it should only output 1 (true) after it has seen the third 1.
\end{solution}
\end{parts}
