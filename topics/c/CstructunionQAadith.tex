Observe the following definitions of the Elf struct, Present union, and Santa struct. Assume that structs are word aligned, and a word is 32b.

\begin{verbatim}
typedef struct Elf {
    int elf_id;
    char sector_name[3];
    char* name;
    void (*doTask)();
} Elf;

typedef union Present {
    char* creator;
    int creator_id
    char location[8];
    byte isCoal;   //bool is 1byte
} Present;

typedef struct Santa {
    unsigned int beard_length;
    short month_num;
    Elf elf_manager;
    Present cur_present;
    Elf* elf_helper;
    void (*HoHoHo)();
} Santa;

\end{verbatim}
