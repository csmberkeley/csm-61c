\question
What is the length of the critical path in the CPU? Which instruction exercises the critical path?  Highlight its path on the diagram above starting from the PC.




\begin{solution}[0.5in]
sw = clk-to-q + memread + max(regfileread, immgen) + mux + alu + memwrite \\
$= 5+150+25+5+100+200 = 485\text{ns}$\\

Path goes from PC $\rightarrow$ IMEM $\rightarrow$ RegFile $+$ ImmGen $\rightarrow$ Amux $+$ Bmux $\rightarrow$ DMem

Even though the load word path uses the most pieces of the processor, since memory write is so much longer than memory read, the \texttt{sw} instruction actually takes the longest time (445 for \texttt{lw} vs 485 for \texttt{sw}).  It first reads from the instruction memory (\texttt{clk-to-q} + \texttt{memread}) and then uses both the \texttt{regfileread} and \texttt{immgen} at the same time, hence why we take the max there.  Then both paths use a \texttt{mux} at the same time which is why only 1 is there and then the \texttt{ALU} combines the \texttt{reg} value with the \texttt{imm}.  Then the value to store is then written to memory.  For \texttt{lw}, the only difference is it reads at the end, muxes, and then writes to the \texttt{reg} block, taking $150+5+5=160\text{ns}$ instead of 200ns.
