\question
Assume you have a RISC-V processor that has the following execution times:

\begin{parts}
\item In an unpipelined processor, what is the maximum clock rate possible?

\begin{solution}
The critical path through the circuit is the entire datapath (all 5 stages).
100 + 150 + 300 + 400 + 250 = 1200 ps \rightarrow 1/1200 s \rightarrow 833 MHz
\end{solution}

\item In a pipelined processor, what is the maximum clock rate possible?

\begin{solution}
The critical path through the circuit is the longest of the stages: Memory
1/400 ps \rightarrow 0.4 GHz
\end{solution}

\item Suppose we add some hardware that shortens the ALU processing time to 250 ns. Does this change the maximum clock rate in an unpipelined processor? In a pipelined processor?

\begin{solution}
In the unpipelined case, the clock rate will be greater because weâ€™ve shortened the critical path. However, in the unpipelined case, the clock rate will not change because the Memory stage is still critical path.
\end{solution}

\end{parts}

\question Fill in the timing diagram for the following code snippet assuming a pipelined processor (the first row has been filled in for you):

\begin{verbatim}
sw	  s1, 0(s0)
addi  t0, t1, 8
add   s2, s0, s1
lw	  t2, 0(t3)
\end{verbatim}

How many cycles did the pipelined processor take? How many would an unpipelined processor take?

\begin{solution}
The pipelined version took a total of 8 clock cycles, whereas an unpipelined processor would have taken 20 equal clock cycles.
\end{solution}
