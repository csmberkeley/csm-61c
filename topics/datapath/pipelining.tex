\question
Assume you have a RISC-V processor that has the following execution times:

\begin{tabular}{ |l|l|l|l|l| } 
 \hline
 IF & ID & EX & MEM & WB \\
 \hline
 100 ps & 150 ps & 300 ps & 400 ps & 250 ps \\
 \hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{parts}
\item In an unpipelined processor, what is the maximum clock rate possible?

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
The critical path through the circuit is the entire datapath (all 5 stages).
100 + 150 + 300 + 400 + 250 = 1200 ps \rightarrow 1/1200 s \rightarrow 833 MHz
\end{solution}

\item In a pipelined processor, what is the maximum clock rate possible?

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
The critical path through the circuit is the longest of the stages: Memory
1/400 ps \rightarrow 0.4 GHz
\end{solution}

\item Suppose we add some hardware that shortens the ALU processing time to 250 ns. Does this change the maximum clock rate in an unpipelined processor? In a pipelined processor?

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
In the unpipelined case, the clock rate will be greater because weâ€™ve shortened the critical path. However, in the unpipelined case, the clock rate will not change because the Memory stage is still critical path.
\end{solution}
