\question How many cycles does this loop take to fully execute (from the first lw to the \texttt{End} label)?

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
$\frac{196}{4} \times 15$  cycles
\end{solution}

\question Now assume the pipeline has 1 delayed branch slot and standard forwarding hardware. Also, reordering of instructions is allowed to minimize stalls. Write out the reordered sequence of instructions that achieves a minimal number of stalls needed. 

\begin{solution}[0.7in]
\begin{verbatim}
lw 	   t1 0(t2)
srl    t1, t1, 16
sw     t1, 0(t2)
addi   t2, t2, -4
sub    t4, t3, t2
bne    t4, x0, Loop
\end{verbatim}
The branch delay slot cannot be used. 
\end{solution}

\question How many cycles does this loop take to fully execute (from the lw to the \texttt{End} label)?

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
$49 \times 8$ cycles
