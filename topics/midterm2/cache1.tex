You are given a RISC-V machine with a single level of 2KiB direct-mapped cache with 512B cache blocks. It has 1MiB of physical address space.

The function foo is ran on the system with a cold cache and as the only process:

\begin{verbatim}
#define ARRAY_LEN 4096
#define STEP_SIZE 64

// A starts at 0x10000
// B starts at 0x20000
foo(int* A, int* B)	{
    int	total = 0;
    for	(int i = 0; i < ARRAY_LEN; i += STEP_SIZE ) {
        total += A[i];
        total -= B[i];
    }
}
\end{verbatim}
