\question
For each instruction dependency below (the line numbers are given), list the type of hazard and the length of the stall needed to resolve the hazard. If there is no hazard, circle “no hazard”.
\begin{solution}
    \begin{verbatim}
    0 → 1: data hazard, 2 cycles
    0 → 3: no hazard
    1 → 3: data hazard, 1 cycle
    2 → 3: data hazard, 2 cycles
    3 → 4: control hazard, 1 cycle
    \end{verbatim}
\end{solution}



\question
Now assume that our CPU now has forwarding implemented as presented in class. Which of these instruction dependencies would cause a pipelining hazard?
\begin{verbatim}
    A. 2 --> 3: ori $t3 $t2 0xDEAD → beq $t2 $t3 label
    B. 2 --> 4: ori	$t3	$t2	0xDEAD →	addiu	$t2	$t3	6
    C. 2 --> 5: ori	$t3	$t2	0xDEAD	→ addiu	$v0	$0	10
    D. 3 --> 4: beq $t2 $t3 label → addiu $t2 $t3 6
    E. None	of	the	above
\end{verbatim}
\begin{solution}
A and D
\end{solution}
