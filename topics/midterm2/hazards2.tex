\question
Now assume that our CPU now has forwarding implemented as presented in class. Which of these instruction dependencies would cause a pipelining hazard?
\begin{verbatim}
    A. 2 --> 3: ori $t3 $t2 0xDEAD --> beq $t2 $t3 label
    B. 2 --> 4: ori	$t3	$t2	0xDEAD --> addiu	$t2	$t3	6
    C. 2 --> 5: ori	$t3	$t2	0xDEAD	--> addiu	$v0	$0	10
    D. 3 --> 4: beq $t2 $t3 label --> addiu $t2 $t3 6
    E. None	of	the	above
\end{verbatim}
