\question
Calculate the hit percentage for this cache after running \lstinline$foo$.
\begin{solution}[0.5in]
$0\%$
\end{solution}


\question
The cache is now cleared and the code is run again. This time, \lstinline$A$ and \lstinline$B$ are pointing to the same array, which starts at \lstinline$0x10000$. Calculate the new hit percentage.
\begin{solution}[0.5in]
$75\%$
\end{solution}


\question
Assume A and B starts once again with a cold cache at \lstinline$0x10000$ and \lstinline$0x20000$. What is the new hit percentage if we ran \lstinline$foo$ on a fully associative cache, with all other parameters staying the same?
\begin{solution}[0.5in]
$50\%$
\end{solution}
