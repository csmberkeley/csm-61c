Prof. Wawrzynek decides to design a new ISA for his ternary neural network accelerator. He only needs to perform 7 different operations with his ISA: \lstinline$xor$, \lstinline$add$, \lstinline$lw$, \lstinline$sw$, \lstinline$lui$, \lstinline$addi$, and \lstinline$blt$. He decides that each instruction should be 17 bits wide, as he likes the number 17. There are no \lstinline$funct7$ or \lstinline$funct3$ fields in this new ISA.

\question What is the minimum number of bits required for the opcode field?
\begin{solution}[0.7in]
$\ceil{\log_2 7} = 3$

Binary encoding, which requires least number of bits, is used here. In order to represent 7 operations, we need at least $\ceil{\log_2 7} = 3$ bits.
\end{solution}

\question
Suppose Prof. Wawrzynek decides to make the \lstinline$opcode$ field 6 bits. If we would like to support instructions with 3 register fields, what is the maximum number of registers we could address?
\begin{solution}[0.7in]
The instruction is 17 bit wide, 6 bits are used for \lstinline$opcode$, we have 11 bits left for register indexing. Given we need 3 register fields, we can have $\floor{\frac{11}{3}} = 3$ bits per register field which means we could address 8 registers.
\end{solution}
