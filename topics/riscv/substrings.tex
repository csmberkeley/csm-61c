You wish to speed up one of your programs by implementing it directly in assembly. Your partner started translating the function \lstinline$is_substr()$ from C to RISC-V, but didn’t finish. Please complete the translation by filling in the lines below with RISC-V assembly. The prologue and epilogue have been written correctly but are not shown.

Note: \lstinline$strlen()$, both as a C function and RISC-V procedure, takes in one string as an argument and returns the length of the string (not including the null terminator).

\begin{verbatim}
/* Returns 1 if s2 is a substring of s1, and 0 otherwise. */
int is_substr(char* s1, char* s2) {
    int len1 = strlen(s1);
    int len2 = strlen(s2);
    int offset = len1 - len2;
    while (offset >= 0) {
        int i = 0;
        while (s1[i + offset]  == s2[i]) {
            i += 1;
            if (s2[i] == ‘\0’) 
                return 1;
        }
        offset -= 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
\end{verbatim}
