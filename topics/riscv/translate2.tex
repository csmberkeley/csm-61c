\question
What is the end array stored starting at register \lstinline$x12$?

\begin{solution}
$[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28]$

Meta: This is a challenging question for students since they are all new to RISC-V. Make sure to walk through and write out each single RISC-V instruction functionality first. Since the lecture will not cover the detailed name for each register, it will be good just going along with \lstinline$x0$ - \lstinline$x31$. Drawing all the detailed memory diagram will be helpful for this question since it involves a lot of load and store instructions.
